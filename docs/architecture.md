# Architecture

This document explains the runtime layout of `termlnk-server`, which packages depend
on which, and the rationale behind a couple of choices that look unusual at first.

## Audience

This is for contributors and self-hosters who want to extend the server. End-user
setup lives in [`self-hosting.md`](./self-hosting.md).

## Runtime in one paragraph

`apps/server/src/index.ts` is a thin Node entrypoint. It loads env, builds the
two stateful adaptors (`NodePgAdaptor` + `IoredisKVStore`), constructs a `Core`
DI container from `@termlnk-server/core`, registers the plugin chain in any
order, and calls `core.start()`. Each plugin registers its DI bindings in
`onStarting()` and mounts its Hono router under `routePrefix` in `onReady()`.
After `start()`, the Hono root app is fully wired and `@hono/node-server`
serves it; `ws` handles WebSocket upgrades for the three streaming routes.

                  apps/server (assembles all of the above)
```

Rules:

- Feature plugins (`auth` / `sync` / `shared-terminal` / `push`) may import from
  `core`, `rpc-server`, `database/repositories`, `crypto`, `kv`, `sync-broadcast`,
  `protocol`. They MUST NOT import from each other — cross-feature concerns belong
  in a shared package, never threaded through another feature. (`shared-terminal`
  is the shared-session bounded context: the former `collab` + `multiplayer`
  packages were merged into it because all three planes — relay / invite admission
  / signalling — key off the same `sessionId`; inside the package they split by
  service + controller, not by package.)
- `database/repositories` exposes interfaces only. Service code never reads
  from `entities` directly.
- `apps/server` is the only place that constructs concrete adaptors
  (`NodePgAdaptor`, `IoredisKVStore`, `RedisSyncBroadcaster`) and pre-binds
  them in the injector before plugins start.

## Plugin lifecycle

A `Plugin` subclass exposes three optional hooks (from `@termlnk-server/core`):

```
constructor(config, @InjectSelf Injector, ...services)
   └─ called by Core.registerPlugins, after the injector is created
onStarting()
   └─ called for every plugin in dependency order; the place to register
      DI bindings via registerDependencies(injector, [...])
onReady()
   └─ called for every plugin in dependency order, AFTER onStarting has
      completed for all plugins; the place to mount Hono routers
```

`@DependentOn(RpcServerPlugin, DatabasePlugin)` on a feature plugin guarantees
both are fully `onReady()` before the feature's `onStarting()` runs. That's
how registration order in `apps/server/src/index.ts` becomes irrelevant — every
feature plugin declares what it needs and the core sorts.

Two cross-cutting bindings are NOT owned by any plugin and must be pre-bound
by the entrypoint (because they're constructed from env): `IKVStore` (ioredis
client) and `ISyncBroadcaster` (Redis pub/sub adaptor). `apps/server/src/index.ts`
does `injector.add([...])` for these before `core.registerPlugins(...)`.

## Hono mount model

`RpcServerPlugin` exposes `IAppService` — a thin wrapper around the root
`OpenAPIHono` app + a `mount(prefix, router)` method. Each feature plugin
constructs its own router in `onReady()`, registers routes against it, and
calls `IAppService.mount('/v1/<feature>', router)`. The OpenAPI plugin walks
all mounted routers when serving `/openapi.json`, so adding a new feature is
genuinely a new package — no central route table.

WebSocket routes (`/sync/poke`, `/shared-terminal/`, `/multiplayer/signal`)
use `@hono/node-server`'s `upgradeWebSocket` middleware. `apps/server/src/index.ts`
constructs a single `ws.WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` and hands it to
the Node adapter, which dispatches upgrades to the matching Hono route. The
sync poke route is wired in `apps/server/src/ws/poke.ws.ts` separately because
its upgrade also needs `ISyncService` from the DI graph.

## Persistence + cross-instance fanout

```
HTTP request
   │
   ▼
feature route handler ── reads/writes via repository interface (driver-agnostic DTOs)
   │
   ▼
PgXxxRepository ── drizzle/pg-core query against NodePgAdaptor.db
   │
   ▼
Postgres
```

```
                            sync push
                                │
                                ▼
                       Postgres write (txn)
                                │
                                ▼
              ISyncBroadcaster.publish(userId, envelope)
                                │
                                ▼              ┌── publishes on `sync:poke:<userId>`
                  RedisSyncBroadcaster ────────┤
                                               └── PG pub/sub (Redis SUB on every replica)
                                │
                                ▼
        Replica B's subscribed handler ── forwards over WebSocket to that user's poke socket
```

Single-instance self-host can swap `RedisSyncBroadcaster` for
`MemorySyncBroadcaster` to skip Redis entirely; the WS contract is
identical because both implement the same `ISyncBroadcaster` interface.

## Error envelope, logging, testing

- **Errors**: every non-2xx is `{ "error": { "code", "message?", "details?" } }`,
  validated against `errorResponseSchema` in `@termlnk-server/protocol`. Throw
  `HttpError(status, code, msg?, details?)` from anywhere in the request path.
  The validator default hook routes Zod failures into
  `HttpError(400, 'invalid_request', …)`. The runtime never leaks SQL or stack
  traces — only the generic `server_error` code escapes.
- **Logging**: `pinoLogger` middleware (from `@termlnk-server/rpc-server/pino-logger`)
  attaches a per-request `c.var.logger` bound to `requestId` (from
  `hono/request-id`). Mode is `'pretty'` for `pnpm dev`, `'json'` otherwise.
- **Tests**: each package owns colocated `*.spec.ts` files. Vitest is run via
  Turborepo (`pnpm test`). Tests use in-memory fakes for repositories and the
  KV / sync broadcaster — no Postgres or Redis needed for unit-level tests.

## Why Plugin/DI instead of factories

The codebase chose `@termlnk-server/core`'s `Plugin` + injector model over
free-standing factory closures because:

1. Feature plugins have non-trivial dependencies (auth + sync + WS) that compose
   through multiple layers. Threading dependency closures through 4-5 layers
   becomes the bulk of the code.
2. The desktop client uses the same DI library, so the protocol package's Zod
   schemas + the service interfaces (`ISyncService`, `IAuthService`, etc.) read
   the same on both sides of the wire.
3. `@DependentOn` ordering replaces hand-written "register in this order"
   comments at the entrypoint — adding a new plugin just declares what it needs.

## Adding a new feature

1. Create `packages/<feature>/` with a `Plugin` subclass, a controller that
   takes `IAppService` in `onReady()`, and a routes module that uses
   `createRoute({ method, path, request, responses })` from `@hono/zod-openapi`.
2. Add schemas to `packages/protocol/src/<feature>.ts`. The desktop client
   imports the same module.
3. Register the plugin in `apps/server/src/index.ts`. Order doesn't matter
   thanks to `@DependentOn`.
4. If the feature needs a new table: add an entity under
   `packages/database/src/entities/`, declare a repository interface in
   `packages/database/src/repositories/`, implement it under
   `packages/database/src/implementations/`, register it in
   `DatabasePlugin._registerDependencies()`, then `pnpm db:generate` to emit
   a new drizzle migration.
